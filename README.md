The two script files to produce the results in the main paper are:

  GenerateSwimmingFigureChlamy.m

  GenerateSwimmingFigureSperm.m
  
(Tested in Matlab 2018a 7th August 2018. Should take seconds to minutes to complete.)



Convergence results in the Supplemental info are produced by:

  GenerateSpermConvergenceTables.m

  GenerateSpermBoundaryConvergenceTables.m

  GenerateChlamyConvergenceTables.m

  GenerateBoundaryConvergenceTables.m

(Convergence checks will take hours to days depending on hardware.)
